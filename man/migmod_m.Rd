\usage{
migmod_m(
  df,
  sending = c("SE", "FI", "IT", "PL"),
  receiving = c("SE", "FI", "IT", "PL"),
  years = 2010:2019,

\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with migration data for sending countries, receiving countries, data quality measures and covariates}

\item{sending}{A vector of ISO2 codes with sending countries to be used in the model (recommended to keep SE and FI)}

\item{receiving}{A vector of ISO2 codes with receiving countries to be used in the model (recommended to keep SE and FI)}

\item{years}{A vector of years to be used in the model (2010 to 2019).}

\item{ref.country}{A character with an ISO2 code receiving country which immigration data are is used as a reference. This assumes that the data reported by this country are not biased. This assumption ensures identification of model parameters. It is strongly recommended to use Sweden ("SE") as a reference.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to function \code{\link[rstan]{sampling}} from package \pkg{\link{rstan}} (e.g. iter, chains) or \code{\link[MigMod]{data_2_standata}}.}

\value{
An object of class \code{stanfit} returned by \code{rstan::sampling}

\description{
The model estimates 'true', unobserved bilateral migration flows \eqn{y_{ijt}} from sending country \eqn{i} to receiving country \eqn{j} in year \eqn{t}. It relies on data reported by receiving countries (immigration, \eqn{z_{ijt}^R}) and sending countries (emigration, \eqn{z_{ijt}^S}). It is based on methodology developed by Raymer \emph{et al}. (2013). The data are Poisson-distributed with mean \eqn{\mu_{ijt}^k}:

\eqn{z_{ijt}^k\sim\mathrm{Poisson}\left(\mu_{ijt}^k\right)}{z_{ijt}^k\sim\mathrm{Poisson}\left(\mu_{ijt}^k\right)}.

The true migration flows then result from correcting the expected values of the data for biases represented by parameters \eqn{\lambda} and different accuracies of the sending and receiving countries' data \eqn{\sigma}:

\eqn{\log\mu_{ijt}^k  \sim \mathrm{normal}\left(\log y_{ijt}+\lambda_{f(i,j)}, \sigma_{g(i,j)}^k\right)}{\log\mu_{ijt}^k  \sim \mathrm{normal}\left(\log y_{ijt}+\lambda_{f(i,j)}, \sigma_{g(i,j)}^k\right)}.

The true flows are then modelled by using a mixed effects model that contains an autoregressive part with parameter \eqn{\phi} and a gravity-type model with populations of sending (\eqn{X_{it}}) and receiving (\eqn{X_{jt}}) countries as well as distance \eqn{D_{ij}} between them:

\eqn{\log y_{ijt}^k  \sim \mathrm{normal}\left(\psi_0 + \psi_{1,ij}\log y_{ijt-1} + \beta_1 \log X_{it} + \beta_2 \log X_{jt} + \beta_3 D_{ij}, \sigma_y\right)}

Note, that this specification requires that there are no fully unobserved flows in the model.
